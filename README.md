Objective: Query the API of the cryptocurrency platform CoinGecko in order to produce an exploratory analysis.

API Documentation: https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3

From the possibilities offered by this API, answer the following questions / take up the challenges:

What are the 50 most valued cryptocurrencies (dollar values / market cap) to date? Respond with visualizations.

From these 50 cryptocurrencies, select one in order to produce an in-depth analysis. Create a chart from the FULL history of the price change of the cryptocurrency.

Optional: Create a web application with Dash / Plotly allowing to visualize the variation of the price of the crypto-currency in real time (by interval of 1 minute). Other visualizations / information can be added to this application.
